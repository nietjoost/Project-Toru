# Project Toru

In Project Toru you play as The architect as your main character where you execute heists. The goal of the game is quite simple as in that you just want to get rich by any means. The game plays with you starting outside of the location you want to steal from. You go in by one of the entrances of your choosing if there are more than one entrance. The levels consist of multiple rooms, at the start of the level you wonâ€™t know what rooms the level consists of and what you can find in there.You just know that somewhere in the building there is something worth stealing. By entering rooms or getting access to a security room you then know what rooms the building consists of and what you can find in each room.
